# CrossCountry Ski AI Wax Advisor
Final project for the Building AI course by Reaktor Innovations and University of Helsinki.

## Summary
CrossCountry Ski AI Wax Advisor is an intelligent app designed to recommend the correct ski wax for optimal performance based on real-time weather conditions and terrain data. It simplifies the process of choosing the right wax, improving the skiing experience for enthusiasts and professionals alike.

## Background
Choosing the right wax for cross-country skiing can be challenging, especially for beginners. Incorrect wax can result in poor glide or grip, making skiing less enjoyable and even frustrating. Weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and snow type significantly impact the wax selection. This problem is common among skiers worldwide.

Problem 1: Difficulty in selecting the correct wax for varying weather conditions.
Problem 2: Lack of user-friendly tools for skiers to optimize their skiing experience.
Problem 3: Wasted time and resources due to trial-and-error methods for waxing skis.
This app solves these issues by providing a convenient and accurate AI-powered recommendation system. My personal motivation stems from being a cross-country skiing enthusiast who has faced this challenge multiple times. By leveraging AI, this project can make skiing more accessible and enjoyable.

## How is it used?
The app works in the following way:

The user inputs details such as skiing location and planned time for skiing.
The app collects real-time weather data for the location, including temperature, humidity, and snow conditions.
The AI analyzes the weather data and recommends the most suitable waxes.
The user receives a detailed recommendation, including application instructions.

## The primary users are:

Recreational skiers who want a hassle-free skiing experience.
Competitive skiers seeking performance optimization.
Ski shops and professionals who want to assist customers with accurate wax selection.

Data sources and AI methods

## Data sources:

Weather data from APIs like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherStack.
Snow condition data from ski resorts and regional skiing organizations.
Historical data on wax performance from skiing experts and manufacturers.

## AI methods:

Regression models to predict the optimal wax based on weather conditions.
Recommendation systems to suggest alternative waxes in case the primary choice is unavailable.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) to allow users to ask the app questions about waxing tips.

## Challenges
This project does not address:

Situations where weather changes drastically after waxing.
Terrain-specific nuances that require manual adjustment to the wax recommendations.
Ethical considerations like ensuring data privacy when collecting user location and preferences.

## What next?
To grow this project, the following steps can be taken:

Integrate additional weather APIs to improve the accuracy of predictions.
Develop a mobile app interface for better usability.
Collaborate with ski wax manufacturers for better data on wax performance.
Introduce community features for skiers to share their experiences and tips.
Add AI-powered tutorials for beginners on how to apply ski wax effectively.
